# DOM Manipulation Exercises

There are different exercises in this repo. Each of them has a `.html` files and a `.js` related.
They all share `grid.css`. I'd say that they are in order of difficulty.

Take a look at the `html` for each exercise and try to replicate it using `jquery`.

Obviously the solutions are in the `js` files, but try to not look at them until you are
completely and angrily frustrated.

### 1. Random

Open `random.html`. There is a grid that changes the color of it's cells randomly every
half second.

### 2. Even

Open `even.html`. There is a grid that changes the color of it's even or odd cells every
half second.

### 3. Move Square

Open `move_square.html`. You can click on one of the cells to make it active. Then you can
move it around with the keyboard. Letters: a, s, d, w.

### 4. Poke Memory

Open `poke_memory.html`. You can click on one of the cells and it will make an ajax call to
the API at `pokeapi.co` to retrieve a sprite for a Pokemon and display it in the cell.

### 5. Auto Snake

Open `auto_snake.html`. You will see a moving snake. You can't control it.

### 6. Snake

Open `snake.html`. A similar snake to the previous snake will appear. Now you can make it change
directions with the keyboard. Letters: a, s, d, w.

Please, feel free to fork and make Pull Requests and I will gladly merge those that are cooler
than mine :)

Keep the code as simple as possible. For Object Oriented solutions, make more files `snake_oo.html`
for example.
